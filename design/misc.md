Something else of note: the maximum number of children of a given state is the number of actions (|A|). If we found an arbitrary transition function with n possible actions could we transform it into a transition function with a tree of length n? Is there a dual relationship here?

It was suggested [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14878580/4496839) that a sequence of numbers can be turned into a tree by interpreting it as a [Pr√ºfer sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%BCfer_sequence).
